One of my favorite spots (and the first spot I found) in Tokyo. It’s not “perfect” but I still really like it, and the staff is always super firendly. It’s a cool café close to Shibuya and Harajuku.

**Food & Drinks**: Interesting drinks and a nice variety of cooked food. Their tuna rice dish is really good. Pasta and pizza is also good!

**Power Outlets**: Available by most seats. Ask for power outlets when you arrive and they’ll help you. (“konsento no seki kudasai”)

**WiFi**: It’s “ok”. Speed is fine, but it can be a bit flaky at peak hours. I wouldn’t go here for downloading huge files.

**Note that smoking is allowed**. There’s a small non-smoking area, but I normally sit in the smoking area, and it usually isn’t a problem (especially earlier during the day).

**Pro Tip**: Arrive in the morning so you can grab a nice counter seat looking out over the street :)
