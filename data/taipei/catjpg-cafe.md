A small cozy cafe. There's supposedly a cat, but I've been here twice and never seen it. Several seating options available but none are particularly comfortable for extended stays due to the hard seats. Friendly staff and students can enjoy a small discount. It gets quite busy and a little noisy (even in the mornings). Even so, it's a great option for those that want to get an early start since they open at 7:30 on weekdays!
