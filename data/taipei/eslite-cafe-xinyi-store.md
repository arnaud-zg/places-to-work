The café inside the Xinyi Eslite department store opens early and closes late, great for those who need to get to work done during off-peak hours. However, the lack of WiFi and power outlets makes this a difficult work spot. Be sure to arrive fully charged and bring a mobile hotspot. At least the interior and views are nice and the seats are comfortable. Food and drinks are a little pricey. You'll need to use one of the street level entrances to access the café when the department store is closed.
