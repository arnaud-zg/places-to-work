This bicycle shop (also known as "CDP" Cycle Dummies Pitstop) features a great workable cafe area with lots of natural light, good cheap drinks, and some simple food options. The WiFi can be slow and unstable at times, but it usually works. There are power outlets by most seats, but not at the large worktable. It opens early and doesn't get too crowded on weekdays.
