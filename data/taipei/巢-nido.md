One of the quietest places to work from in Taipei. It's a "silent cafe" so talking isn't allowed. Despite the unappealing outside, the inside looks very modern and clean. There is calm background music, comfortable seats, power outlets, and fast WiFi. Desserts, tea, coffee are available. To access, look for no. 183 and ring the buzzer for "nido", then head to the second floor. It can get busy in the afternoon, so it's best to arrive early to get a good seat.
