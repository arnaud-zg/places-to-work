# Places to Work
Find places to work. Open and collaborative. Pull requests welcome!

## Updating a city
Want to add/update places in a city?
1. [Fork the repo](fork)
2. Edit the JSON file (`data/cities/<name>.json`)
3. Submit a pull request
4. Recommended: validate JSON using `npm test`

## Adding a new city
Want to add a new city?
1. Create a JSON file listing places (`data/cities/<name>.json`) 
2. Create an HTML file with basic metadata (`_cities/<city>.html`)
3. Add the city to the nav bar in `_layout/default.html` (not automatic yet...)
4. Recommended: validate JSON using `npm test`

## Tips
- Before adding a new place, make sure to search to check that it doesn't already exist
- If any information is incorrect or the ratings seem off, feel free to create a pull request
- For chains that serve the exact same food/drinks (e.g. Starbucks), consider using the same ratings as the other places for consistency.
